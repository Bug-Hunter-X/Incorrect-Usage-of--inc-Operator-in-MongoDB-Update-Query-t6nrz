# Incorrect Usage of $inc Operator in MongoDB Update Query
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update queries. The `$inc` operator is used to increment or decrement a numeric field by a specified value. However, if the field does not exist, it behaves differently than operators like `$set`.  The solution shows how to handle cases where the field might not exist to ensure the operation behaves correctly.

## Bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator. If the field does not exist, `$inc` will not create it, resulting in no change to the document. This can lead to unexpected behavior and debugging challenges.  This example highlights this issue.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle situations where the target field might not exist. By using the `$inc` operator in conjunction with the `$setOnInsert` operator, or by using an alternative approach that checks if the field exists first. We can ensure that the operation will work as expected even if the field does not exist.
